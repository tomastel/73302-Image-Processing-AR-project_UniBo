# [Augmented Reality project](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2023/467993)
*Project in the course 73302 at [The University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/)*

As a part of my master's degree in cybernetics and robotics, I spent one semester abroad in Bologna, Italy in the autumn of 2023.

This individual project was a mandatory part of a course in computer vision and image processing. The project consisted of writing a script able to take in a video of a book and producing a new video with a given augmented layer placed on top, using the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) Python library. The original video's camera trajectory has translations and rotations, as well as slow and rapid brightness changes.
